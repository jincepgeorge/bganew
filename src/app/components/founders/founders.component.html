                <p>A handful of Keralites arrived in the city of New York over 30 years ago seeking a new life. It was in this quest that Rev. Dr. Joy P. Oommen had the intention of  establishing a source for earning souls for the Lord by establishing a house for God by the Name "New York Gospel Assembly." The migration of Malayalee Pentecostals to the US was met with much adversity yet, NYGA served as a spiritual haven for those who came for a better future for themselves and their children. Starting as a dream, New York Gospel Assembly held its first service on Sunday, May 24, 1970 at our first church building on 20 -15th street in Manhattan. From there we moved to 101 Richmond Hill, NY 11419.  As the first incorporated Malayalee Pentecostal church in America, NYGA took many first steps including providing a spiritual atmosphere for the youth. Led by the ideas of Sis. Grace P. Oommen, our beloved pastor's wife, the CA and Sunday School program went into effect with the help of  Bros. Sunny Phillip and Benjamin Baby. In fact, the formation of the Pentecostal Youth Fellowship of America (P.Y.F.A) was headed and initiated by NYGA in 1980. Years of spiritual prosperity and success followed until 1995, where we sought to purchase a new sanctuary. Not having to search far, God graciously helped find a place less than10 blocks away, that more than fulfilled our needs. Here we presently worship our savior Jesus Christ at 133 -17 101 Ave Richmond Hill, NY 11419. Over 30 years of hard work and blessings have come together to provide the atmosphere of praise and worship that fill our sanctuary every time we gather to worship his name. To him be all the glory, honor, and praise.</p>
